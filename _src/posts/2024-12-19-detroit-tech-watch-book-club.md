Announcing the free Detroit Tech Watch book club to help technologists step up their technical game.

I decided that I want to read [_How To Design Programs_](https://htdp.org) since it often comes up in discussions of the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org). I can read it all by myself (often do, in fact) but reading it with other nerds is a way to make it more fun and to hear the insights of others.  So I decided that it was time to start a Detroit Tech Watch book club.  I put the book club on [Fable](https://fable.co).  It's free to join and it's got some nice features for organizing group reading.  The book club itself is [here](https://fable.co/club/dettechwatch-book-club-with-onorio-catenacci-178852936285?referralID=3akW7tRQ77). 

If you're reading this (I'm waving at my fans!  Both of them!) consider yourself invited to join the nerdfest!
