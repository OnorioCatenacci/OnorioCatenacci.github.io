Due to the inability of a previously invited speaker to attend, I'm filling in at MITechCon for a session.

I submitted a couple of talks to [MITechCon](https://www.mitechcon.org) but they weren't accepted.  I'm fine with that--happens all the time.  But knowing one of the organizers very well and having organized an event or two myself over the years I let him know that if he had any need to fill in I'd be happy to help.  Well, unfortunately, one of the folks they had selected wasn't able to fulfill his obligation so here I am filling in to help.

I'll be giving my "Accidental Complexities I Have Known And Hated" talk which I previously gave over at Ann Arbor Tech Convergence.  Honestly I'm just glad I can help the organizers of MITechCon out a bit.  I got a lot of help when I used to organize and it feels very good to be able to repay the favor (in a way.)
