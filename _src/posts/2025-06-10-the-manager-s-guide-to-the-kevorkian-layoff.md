In this job market getting rid of that pesky staff (or as many managers call them “wage leeches”) has never been easier.  But if you lay them off then they collect unemployment and who want to have the wage leeches continuing to drain your profits?  Even worse if you lay off enough of them at once some kind of legal nonsense kicks in and it gets even more expensive.  While we’ve got a friend in the White House (yay DJT!) we can’t always stomp all over the wage leeches like we’d like to. So many companies are pursuing a “Kevorkian Layoff” strategy–that is, make people want to fire themselves and they don’t get any unemployment.  A win/win (well at least from the accountant’s perspective anyway). Even better, you can keep on telling the entire world that you’d rather sleep on people’s couches than to lay people off.  No official layoffs–just the Kevorkian Layoff where people can no longer stand working for you so they terminate themselves.

But how can you do this?  In this frozen job market people are clinging more and more desperately to their jobs no matter how terrible you make things. Here are some simple strategies you can take to protect that bottom line while still shedding those useless wage leeches!

1.  __Return To Office!__
This is a strategy that lots of companies are following these days.  Make sure you couch it in some high-flown language about “synergy” and “collaboration” but also make sure there are no exceptions and no one works from home!  After all, you’re trying to get people to terminate themselves so you want to make the terms as odious as you can.  Someone needs to stay home because their kid’s sick?  That’s their problem–make them burn a vacation day.  Someone’s got COVID-19 due to attending a mandatory company event but they are asymptomatic?  We can’t have them working from home even though they could–make ‘em take vacation.
2. __Assign them the most miserable jobs possible.__
    * Need that bathroom cleaned that's not been touched since the Reagan administration?  Why waste money on custodial staff when you’ve got able-bodied wage leeches sitting at their desks surfing the web?
    * Promised a customer some new niche feature that will take months to actually implement?  Give the wage leeches three days to get it out.  Make sure you’re constantly micromanaging them while they suffer through your death march.  Oh and don’t forget to include useless ceremonies for no particular reason than keeping your team from doing the job you’re paying them to do.  Daily standups only take five minutes?  You’re doing something wrong–you need to keep those wage leeches away from their desks for much longer!
3. __Promote the worst managers.__
Have lots of the wage leeches complaining about a micro-manager? Hello new VP in charge of driving off wage leeches!  Of course it gets tougher to micro-manage as you get further and further away from the low-level wage leeches so make sure your bad managers can bring along their buddies.  Low talent management tends to favor other low talent management because they’re afraid that if they appoint someone good beneath them they may lose their own job.
4. __Toxic Positivity!__
    * Never fail to remind your  wage leeches how very privileged they are to be working in your digital sweatshop. Have your teams name an employee of the week and then make sure the biggest brown-noser wins “employee of the week” on the regular.
    * Have people broadcast via emails to the entire company about the latest version of their internal software and act as if they’re not just doing their job–they’re practically curing cancer. Make sure you encourage all the people sending along "Congratualtions!" emails to cc the entire company again!  You really want to annoy those wage leeches!
    * Never stop reminding the wage leeches how even though most of them asked for the ability to work from home and you just couldn’t do that instead you gave them ping-pong tables, pinball machines, video games, an in-office coffee shop and tons of other “perks”  instead!
    * Don’t forget to pay off the local newspapers for your high ranking in the “best places to work” polls.  It’s annoying but it really helps to drive home the irony which leads even more people to the Kevorkian Layoff.
