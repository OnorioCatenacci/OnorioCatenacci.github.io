    Title: Codeberg and Reinventing A Wheel

I decided to give Codeberg a whirl.  I also decided to create a binary tree implementation in Rust to practice my Rust skills a bit.

I have to say that while I have some concerns about MS (and indeed Google) owning everything and continuing to own everything by dint of their embrace of AI, I haven't been exactly stampeding off of github.  I mean while I'm more than a little uncomfortable with MS having access to a large set of training data for their coding AI tools, I haven't made a move to stop it yet either.  But I have decided to try out a less invasive alternative.  [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/about) is a non-profit for hosting Git repos. From what I've seen of it it seems as if it's worth checking out at the least.

And on Codeberg, I posted a repo [oc_btree](https://codeberg.org/OldDutchCap/oc_btree) which is my very modest (and, seriously if you've somehow found this blog post, don't use my binary tree for _anything_!) implementation of a binary tree in Rust. I'm trying to better understand Rust's ownership model and how it works in practice.

At any rate, I felt like letting folks know about this.
