I'm going to be speaking at Ann Arbor Tech Convergence.  You should attend!

<!-- more -->

As we continue in this rather icy post-pandemic tech world one of the things I've been craving more and more is to be able to spend time chatting with other technical folks.  I'm an introvert but even I get more energized by talking with other people about tech.  That's why I was very pleased to see some folks over in Ann Arbor, MI putting together a local meetup of meetups which they call [Tech Convergence](https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Inclusive). 

_Yes I know that says "Tech Inclusive." They run the Tech Convergence meetup via the Tech Inclusive group.  I didn't link things wrong!_ 

I've already had the privilege of speaking to one of their meetings--it was AWESOME!  Great questions, great participation--10 out of 10! I will once again have the privilege of speaking to them in January. That meetup's details are here:

I really hope that if you're reading this that you'll join us. I confess that a deep love of talking shop and learning from other technical people is one of the most enjoyable things I can think to do!
