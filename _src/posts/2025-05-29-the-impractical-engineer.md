I've started a newsletter called "The Impractical Engineer". I hope you'll give it a look!

I decided to start "The Impractical Engineer" because I often have things I'd like to share with other software developers.  Blogging is, of course, one way to share them.  This newsletter is another way to share things.

# The Name

I decided to call my newsletter "The Impractical Engineer" because I have deep admiration for the Pragmatic Programmers.  Not only did they write a great book but they've continued to share lots of interesting technical literature.  However, as much as I admire them in some ways I feel like I'm just the opposite of these sharp folks.  Hence "The Impractical Engineer"! I mean I guess about the only thing I share with them is my love of learning.

# What's In It?

I'm glad you asked.  For now we have:

* A Technical Book Review
* A Puzzle (since I know a lot of us enjoy puzzles)\
* A List of Events Upcoming for the month
* A Bit of Developer Humor (I hope).

It's free, it's easy to subscribe, it's easy to unsubscribe and I hope it's a good time for all the readers.  You can subscribe via the new link below.  I hope you'll give it a look and if you do, you'll please share any feedback you care to share.
