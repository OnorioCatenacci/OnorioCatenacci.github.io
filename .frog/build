Elixir</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in FP for years because to my mind it gives us a nice way to remove one accidental complexity that seems innate (but is not) in software development. That is accidental mutation of values. As I&rsquo;ve said to people repeatedly mutation of itself is neither good nor bad; it&rsquo;s simply something that is essential in certain situations. Accidental mutation&mdash;that is the unintentional changing of values&mdash;is an accidental complexity that we should strive to remove as much as possible. A lot of people have set a lot of bytes discussing why accidental mutation is a problem so I won&rsquo;t belabor the point.</p>\n\n<p>Elixir has the wonderful property of being functional first and being built on the industrial strength Erlang VM. I&rsquo;m sure there are lots of folks who will see this and think to themselves &ldquo;Oh God here&rsquo;s another shiny new object for developers to chase&rdquo; and that&rsquo;d be underselling the importance of the fundamental change of approach that is present in Erlang and it&rsquo;s VM.</p>\n\n<p>2.) Racket</p>\n\n<p>You may have guessed by the fact I used Frog to create this static site that I have some interest in Racket. I confess I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of interest in LISP family languages but like so many others I wish John McCarthy had picked something besides parentheses to express syntax.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I find Racket so interesting is the fact that after years and years of hearing about creating domain specific languages (DSL) within our coding paradigms here is a tool that actually gives you the ability to create a DSL and a pretty robust one at that.</p>\n\n<p>3.) Formal Methods and Formal Modeling</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to wrap my head around these similar ideas for a few years now. When you&rsquo;re self-taught that wonderful moment of the light of realization breaking through the clouds of confusion can take a while to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that more than one extremely smart person seems to have some interest in Formal Methods and Formal Modeling seems to indicate this is worth the time I&rsquo;ve been struggling to understand it.</p>")) ((? . 1) f post (u .
